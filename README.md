Our paper is under review and we will release the code upon acceptance of the paper.

- 2024/11/01  We released the ODS dataset. We construct a large-scale oral disease segmentation (ODS) dataset containing 2602 image pairs. It covers three common oral diseases (including dental plaque, calculus and caries) and all age groups, which we hope will advance the field. You can download it from [[here\]](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1XrliSh9fdKs0cmx3kN_nIw?pwd=lblo)(lblo) or [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xqWbVBtGSA4nAQE6MYJpy37sj8O6wms5/view?usp=sharing).
